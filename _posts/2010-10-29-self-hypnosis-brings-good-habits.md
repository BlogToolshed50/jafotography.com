To get started with self-hypnosis, you will of course need a professional hypnotist to guide you. These people will be the ones to help you with the instructions and the procedure. The whole procedure is different for every person. Some people will find it easier to manage while others can completely lose into it. After all, they will basically depend on the subconscious and will need to have the strength of mind to deal with it.

Self-hypnosis may not however be as effective as being done by a professional but the peace of mind and independence that you get from knowing that you are in control can mean a lot to some people. This knowledge of having the power to change yourself sometimes make up for the limitations that self-hypnosis brings to the table. The progress for instance with self-hypnosis may not be as fast with one professionally done. But as most patients have already implied, slow but sure is better than making a major change through the hands of an incompetent hypnotist. 

There is no need to worry about safety. Just because you are doing it does not mean that it is any less safe. There is no truth to the claims that self-hypnosis can open the mind for the devil to enter or that people can get crazy because of it. A person under self-hypnotic state will have the same safeguards as with ordinary life. Actually, there is not much difference. The difference lies in the segment of the personâ€™s personality that he or she wishes to change. 

All in all self-hypnosis is an effective tool in curbing bad habits and lessening pain but the jury is still out on whether it can go mainstream.
