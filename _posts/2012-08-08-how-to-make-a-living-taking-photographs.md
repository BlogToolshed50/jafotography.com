You need to have a passion for photography if you wish to earn a living from it. Practically any one can point and shoot a camera, however when it comes to making a career out of it it needs a lot more ability than just that. There are courses in photography that you can take, but it is also one of those professions where talent and experience outweigh qualifications.

To make money from taking photographs you also need to have a head for business. You can opt to go freelance and go from one job to another, find work as an in-house photographer or simply establish your own business. There are all different fields of photography too. You may wish to pursue a career as a fashion photographer or photo-journalist. You can make money from just snapping celebrities out and about, but this takes a lot of patience; it helps to have loads of the rights contacts and the ability to be in the right place at the right time! Or perhaps you wish to start your own photography company which specializes in weddings and events. This list is endless, but the key remains the same in that you have to be passionate about it. You have to be prepared to take the rough with the smooth, withstand rejection and remain focused and have the determination to succeed.

This is because having a successful career as a photographer doesn&#8217;t happen overnight. Many photographers start off taking photographs for fun, as a hobby in their spare time. It&#8217;s important to develop a portfolio of your work and get your work out there and seen. You can do this by entering photography competitions, advertising your work online, volunteering your photography skills to friends and simply submitting your work to publications or companies. You can&#8217;t beat hands on experience, so seek work experience or apply for an internship that involves photography. There are many websites (stock photo companies) where you can sign up and submit your work to sell. Be sure to do your research and explore every avenue and business opportunity available.

In order to make a living as a photographer you need to establish your reputation. Find your niche and build on your experience. Keep up to date with the latest technology too, always be flexible and never sell yourself short.

Your photographs and attitude to your profession are what will make you a success. Be prepared to start off small and at the bottom. Don&#8217;t fear rejection, because this will become common practice when you start out. For many, photography remains a hobby, but if you&#8217;re persistent and passionate you can make a living from it.
