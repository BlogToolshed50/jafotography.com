Do you know that the passive smoking is very dangerous than the active smoking? Yes it is proven by a recent study in the United States that the passive smokers can easily get affected by so many diseases like heart attack, cancer and similar other problems. The extent of Nicotine that is inhaled is more in the case of passive smokers. Many countries are enacting various legislation to prevent smoking in public places with the sole aim of protecting the non smokers. I also support such controls on the smokers vehemently since it is going to help millions of people who are non smokers. Even the companies manufacturing the cigarettes and related products should come out with proper safeguards to avoid such evils.

In some of the developing countries the legislation is so strict that people are prohibited to smoke in the public places like railway station, bus stand, hospitals and hotels. In the USA, many of the research were conducted on lots of non-smokers to prove the ill effects of passive smoking. One step ahead I will suggest that the governmental agencies must stipulate exorbitant penalties on those who smoke and add to the misery of non smokers. The media should also play a very positive role worldwide in the matter of creating the awareness among the mas about the various evils of smoking.
