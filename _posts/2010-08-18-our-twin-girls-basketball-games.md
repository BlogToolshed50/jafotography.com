I have always made it a point to set my &nbsp;ADT Alarm&nbsp; prior to leaving for our kids sporting events. The local police have put out a warning to parents, that there has been an increase in home burglaries during the extracurricular sporting events in our area. It is nice to be able to watch your kids participate in fall sports without having to worry if your home is safe or not.

We have twin girls and they both play on the &nbsp;junior varsity basketball team&nbsp;. My husband and I enjoy watching him play. We would not be able to really relax and have a good time if we did not know that things would be all right at home. Instead we can spend our time, witnessing our daughters have the time of her life.

Children grow up so fast, so we want to cherish all the moments that we can with our girls. We look forward every week to attending our daughters&#8217; games. This year they have a big chance of winning their district championship. We set aside this time every week to be together whether it is a home game or the weeks that they play out of town. After the games we usually take the girls out to eat pizza and reminisce over all the exciting moments of the game. None of this would be possible if we did not know that are home was secure.
