This is a guest post by Alex Tellies

When I was a child the word Internet did not exist. I think back to when I would spend quality time with my own mother, and how much that meant to me. We would draw, play games, go shopping, and do all the things that I am still able to do with my own children, except now we do a lot of it using our &nbsp;hughesnet Nevada&nbsp; internet service.

Having teenage boys it&#8217;s hard to imagine that there is anything we could have in common regarding the Internet. I&#8217;m weird; I still consider playing games and goofing off fun. One of the things that we like to do with &nbsp;hughes satellite&nbsp; is play online games. Whether it&#8217;s trivia or some war game, we still have a blast. We also enjoy watching homemade videos on line. My youngest is a media nut and we can spend hours viewing videos. Music is usually playing off the computer too, and as long as it isn&#8217;t rap I dig it.
  
Most teens wouldn&#8217;t &#8220;accept&#8221; their moms as friends on the social networking sites, but mine do. I respect their privacy and usually let them do the socializing with their friends. When they include me it’s fun because I get to peak into their “oh so private” lives. Whenever we are bored, we power up &nbsp;hughesnet internet service&nbsp; and really enjoy each other&#8217;s company.
