Property Right is the fundamental Human Right. As we observe, the property right is absent in many countries. This has resulted in the poverty in many countries worldwide. The insecurity of the property right is also causing the poverty. In fact, the lack of access to the land and other natural resources has become the major source for the disfranchisement, more particularly for the vulnerable group like women in the society.

There must be a functional and balanced and equitable property right system that can bestow the rights on the most deserving ones. In the present economic scenario, such system will enable the poor to empower themselves and start small business for their own sustenance. In turn, this will help the government also to divert the attention for the development activities rather than spending the time and energy in feeding such poor.

Even the property rights become handy for the people to establish their legal identity in the society. Every government should strive hard to develop the system and effective regulations to enable the poor and down trodden to gain the property right. This will eventually empower them to vote in a democracy and participate in the nation building.
