Edward G. Robinson was an actor not given his proper due. At least not by enough movie critics. Tonight I am going to catch his flick entitled &#8220;Confessions of a Nazi Spy.&#8221; Being interested in the time frame in which the Movie takes place, this is a film I am looking forward to seeing, again.

In this film he is an FBI man tracking down Nazi spies prior to the U.S. involvement in World War II. After setting my &nbsp;securitychoice&nbsp; home security system which is easy to manipulate, I set off for the theater. Only recently I got into the habit of having a preference for the classic films. With these films it is not imperative to have the high definition screens. That is for viewing sporting events.

Going to the Movies is a great opportunity to relax and recharge your batteries. I prefer the classic style of acting where facial expressions and non-verbal gestures were worth a thousand words. I don&#8217;t see the actors of today being as good as those of past generations. &nbsp;Tom Cruise&nbsp; is an exception in my opinion.
