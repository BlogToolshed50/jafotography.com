Since the airing of “The Secret”, thousands of people across the globe have come to understand a little about the law of attraction. Tens of thousands of people search the Internet every single day for more information on how to use the law of attraction to get more of the things they want in their lives. Perhaps you are one of them.

But there are also people who have misunderstood the basic premise behind the law of attraction. In truth, the law of attraction is still not fully understood, even by the big teachers. Those who have misunderstood the law of attraction, state that there is no such thing as magic or supernatural things. That is not what the law of attraction is about.

The law of attraction is more along the lines of something called electromagnetic attraction. In physics, this is what holds the planets in our solar system in place. In the mental world, it’s what attracts people to each other, in friendships and romantic relationships.

In your every day life, every thing that enters your experience is there by attraction. You literally attract events, circumstances, people, and things into your experience. It’s more than what you’re consciously thinking and feeling, and it is a conglomeration of the deeper levels of you as well. In fact, you may not be aware of much deeper levels of you that are overriding your conscious awareness.

This is why the law of attraction has been so difficult to grasp and understand. In ancient times, people thought that the sun would go into the ocean at the end of each day. Now we know better than that. We know that it is an illusion due to our frame of reference. The same thing goes for each of our lives. We tend to think that things just happen to us by chance or that perhaps someone or something outside of ourselves is rewarding or punishing us. Many people have strong beliefs around this, and whether they realize it or not, they are responsible for everything that is going on their lives.

In quantum physics, scientists have discovered that the tiniest particles of matter seemed to defy all logic and rules that we have come to know in our physical world. We just couldn’t figure out what was going on there. But then we started to notice that these tiny sub-atomic particles behaved differently when they were being observed. The mere act of observing caused these particles to behave differently. That is significant. It shows that what we think of as being ‘set in stone’ can actually be changed according to our own inner vibration.

Quantum physicists have also discovered that everything in this universe is energy. At our core, you and I are pure vibrating energy. We just interpret certain frequencies as a table, hand, or computer. But in reality, it is nothing but energy. Think about that for a moment…

Law of attraction states that like attracts like. Your frequency, vibration or tune attracts like frequencies and tunes. Although, there is still much to learn about quantum physics and the law of attraction, it is evident that these concepts can be used to overcome limiting beliefs and obstacles.
