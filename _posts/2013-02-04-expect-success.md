The brain is the most powerful computer on the planet. It has the capability to process data at incredible speeds. Almost everything in the body is controlled by the brain. Consider all of the involuntary actions that occur without us being aware of them transpiring. Actions such as breathing, the beating of our hearts, and blood circulation are just some of the examples of what transpires without our conscious thought. Of course, this is such a powerful instrument that it has the capability to create things outside the body too.

It is a time proven strategy that people get what they continually focus upon. Unfortunately, the conditioned habit of most people is to think about the negative consequences. When confronted with a situation, they will often devise the worst case scenario. Projections in the future are never in the positive. Naturally, the brain manifests exactly what it created-the worst possible scenario. Ever notice how extremely negative people’s lives are in total chaos? They have every type of hardship while never “catching a break”. The question is often asked, “Are they negative because their life is in turmoil or is their life in turmoil because of the negative thinking”? The latter seems to be more common.

An extremely negative person rarely can improve life without a radical shift in the thought process. The reason is because of the universal principal called the law of attraction. Basically this says that we will attract what we put out there. Emit negativity and that’s what is received back. Put out good energy and good things are attracted to you. It is universal since it works in all circumstances. Don’t believe it? Ever hear the saying “misery loves company”? Ever notice how whiners and complainers all seem to draw to each other? This is their common bond where they can feel comfortable. Notice, too, how positive people avoid this group like the plague.

People are not the only ones drawn to what you put out there. Results are also created by our focus. Everything is made up of energy. The thoughts that we project outward attract results on a similar plane. Thus, when you think about situations being resolved in ways that you view as negative, you are going to get exactly that. Fortunately, when we take the reverse approach, we get positive results.

The easiest way to control what we put out there is through our expectations. Up until this point, the general tendency is to expect the worst (or something bad occurring). It is time to make this shift. From this point forward, expect success in all that you do. Let the universe know that your mind is wired for all that good that is available to you. Do it in all situations. When you go to a store, expect to get a parking spot in front. Expect to close the sale. Expect that she/he will say yes to going out with you. Expect that you will lose the weight. EXPECT SUCCESS and it shall be yours.
