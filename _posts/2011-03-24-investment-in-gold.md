Gold Futures is also one among the methods of trading and investing in the gold for better return. It is an agreement entered between the buyer and seller to do the deal on a future date according to the rate agreed as on the date of entering into the agreement. If the price goes up the buyer will get benefited. When there is price reduction than, the buyer is affected to that extent. The delivery of the gold is to be given on the agreed future date. This is a type of speculative trade where one has to have better knowledge of the market to get the profit.
