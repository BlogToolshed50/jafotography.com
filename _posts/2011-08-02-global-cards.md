Global cards are nothing but the credit and debit cards that can be used worldwide at various places. The bankers to the issue makes a consortium and enable the customer of a financial institution to use the card at the other&#8217;s branch. The customers are given with the card embedded with the logo say: &#8220;visa&#8221; and they will be able to use the other outlets where they see the logo. Cash dispensation is also enabled in these outlets and the settlement of such transaction is done periodically among the participating banks who are the consortium members in issuing such cards. It is the best way of offering value added service to the customer of one bank to use the facility at the other bank.
