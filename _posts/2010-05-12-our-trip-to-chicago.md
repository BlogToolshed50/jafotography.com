This is a guest post by Randy Kable

Living in a town of around 800 people, the thought of driving to Chicago scared me to death. I was the one who would be driving and I was very nervous. But the family wanted to go there for vacation this year and my wife’s boss offered to pay for our hotel just because he was from that area and my wife worked pretty hard for him. How could I refuse?

I set the &nbsp;adt missouri&nbsp; alarm system for our house and we were off to Chicago. It took longer than it would take most people because we had a 2 year old and he gets bored easily. So every hour we had to find somewhere to stop and let him run. This was a nice way for me to calm my nerves before I hit the heavy Chicago traffic.

I had my first experience with a toll road on the way. I didn’t know it was a toll road until I got in line. Now I know what a &nbsp;NASCAR&nbsp; driver feels like when he’s leaving pit road. I had to fight for position without ramming into somebody.

When we finally arrived in Chicago I was awestruck with how big it was and how tall the buildings were. Thank goodness my wife’s boss gave us great directions or I might still be driving around looking for our hotel.

After we checked in the kids wanted to go swimming. I found out the pool was on the third floor. I had never heard of such a thing, but off we went. When we found the pool it was an indoor pool that had a beautiful mural painted on the wall beside it. The kids splashed around for a while but it was time to get something to eat.

I wanted Chicago style pizza but never did get it because I ended up on Michigan Avenue going 80 as cars were flying by me. I found a nice quiet place to relax my nerves. On the way home though we did find a place that served Chicago style pizza, so I was happy.
