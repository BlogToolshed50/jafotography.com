Individuals who decide on using digital SLR or DSLR types of cameras should really invest on memory cards and lenses. Thus, if they happen to become professionals someday, additional equipment will surely keep them busy for choosing photography as a career. 

Here are some helpful tips that will definitely aid owners of DSLR cameras in capturing a perfect image using the new art of digital photography. 

Normally, people take full body shots against a background. However, it is more appropriate to take a shot from shoulders up or an upper body one because image of those in the picture really appear small.

If doing the above technique happens to be difficult for the user, he or she can take a shot of the person with him or her at one side rather than at the center. Then the owner can just zoom in so the person appears to be at the center. 

The law of optics remains the same whether using an old or a digital camera. For instance, if the sun is behind an image, the picture will be silhouette. If light is in front of the image, the picture will appear squint unless there are sunglasses on. 

Use your sunglass to act as a polarizer to take away unnecessary reflections from glaring objects.

You can also use a sunglass to increase the exposure of objects.

When using a polarizer, be sure that the source of light is perpendicular to the object.

Change your white balance setting from auto to cloudy when shooting bright landscapes and outdoor portraits.

Do not use the flash mode when the setting is already sunny.

Zoom in to emphasize a certain asset or characteristic of the subject being captured.

Practice. Practice. Practice. 

It suffices to say that the techniques in getting the perfect shot have not changed. However, using digital cameras and employing this new art of digital photography have simply improved photo shooting by making capturing pictures easy for everyone. In other words, practice is really makes perfect shots!
