My favorite part of watching the World Cup is that it is a chance to see the best players in action. &nbsp;Ronaldo&nbsp;, Kaka, Messi, Hamsik, Donovan, Rooney, Gerrard, Torres, Villa, and Fabregas are all there this year. Granted, many excellent players did not make it to the World Cup such as Arshavin. Hey, that just proves that one star player does not make a winning team.

Another favorite part of the World Cup is you get to see the best teams in action. Soccer is a team sport after all. You have eleven guys each on two teams battling for victory. I play soccer myself, and I know the stakes cannot get higher then the World Cup. Just making it to the World Cup and playing a match for your country is a big honor. Many great players have missed the opportunity and have watched the action from home instead. I will be watching the World Cup intently on some of the &nbsp;best cable tv offers&nbsp;. Brazil, Argentina, Spain, and Italy, these are strong teams. We don&#8217;t get to see them play everyday. In the World Cup we get a chance to witness the incredible talent, and skill of teams such as Brazil. Whether or not you support Brazil, their style of play is very pleasing to the eye. Furthermore Brazil is the most successful country in the World Cup. It is always exciting to see who will come out as world champions. This is why I watch the World Cup.
