An old proverb reads, A poor man is not he without a cent, it is he without a vision. This website is the result of one man&#8217;s vision, turned into action. I wanted to create a place that would integrate teens from all over in a positive atmosphere&#8217; to interact, engage, and debate. I wanted to give our generation a good name for a change, and show the world our potential&#8217; that we are globally aware, articulate, passionate, and have a strong voice that can&#8217;t be ignored.

Having high aspirations taught me that the question is rarely what you can or cannot accomplish, but merely how badly you wish to achieve your goals. It forced me to decide for myself what was important for me, and strive to make my goals a reality. In that same vain, nothing you set out to achieve is beyond your abilities, as long as you desire to make them happen. This is my vision. Help me make it become even more of a reality.

We recently launched with many features, and have several other features in the works. Keep it real. Have fun. Enjoy!
