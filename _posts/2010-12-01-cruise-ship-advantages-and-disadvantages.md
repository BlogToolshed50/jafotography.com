Vacations can become costly. The cost is often associated with extra expenses such as food, beverages, and entertainment. If you plan vacationing aboard a cruise ship, you do not necessarily have to be worried about the cost. 

All inclusive cruise ship is a ship where just about everything is included. The cost of your drinks, food, and entertainment are often taken care of. Many people wonder whether or not they you should book reservations aboard a traditional cruise ship or an all inclusive cruise ship.

There are many advantages and disadvantages to an all inclusive cruise ship. 

The biggest advantage is that the majority of your needs are taken care of. Most all inclusive cruises cover food, drinks, and entertainment. If you plan to drink a large amount of alcohol or feasting on the amazing onboard food, you may be able to do so free of charge. You may also be granted exclusive admittance into movie theatres and video arcades. 

While many of your food and drinks are included in an all-inclusive package, not all are. It is possible that you may be required to pay for your alcoholic beverages. There are some cruise ships where alcohol beverages are included in the package, but on others it is not.

When it comes to food, your food at a sit-down restaurant may be provided free of charge, but your snacks are typically not covered. This often includes snacks or small meals purchased at onboard specialty shops and vending machines. You can save money by brining your own snacks onboard, if the cruise ship allows it. 

Entertainment is often included in an all inclusive cruise ship package. As with food and drinks, the entertainment is often limited. It is likely that you will gain free admission into a dance or ball, but you will not be able to gamble free of charge. 

To find out whether or not you will save money aboard an all inclusive cruise ship, you should estimate your cost of food, drinks, and entertainment aboard a traditional cruise. By comparing the two, you can determine which cruise package offers the better deal.
