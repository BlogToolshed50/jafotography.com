Online home business opportunities utilize the strengths of the Internet. A good opportunity will, for example, give you the tools you need to accomplish the marketing and advertising aspects of your business &#8211; without ever having to test the goodwill of your circle of acquaintances. You may, for example, have your own website to which you can drive traffic. An Internet traffic generator can send thousands &#8211; or hundreds of thousands &#8211; of prospective downline members to your site. 

Traditional MLMs fail for many people because we have a hard time closing the sale. In contrast, the new wave of home business opportunities employs a call centre to close all of your prospects for you. 

Similarly, Internet-based home business opportunities will often have an expensive means (such as an e-book) of teaching you everything you need to know about harnessing the power of the Internet to achieve your financial goals. This information is invaluable for both the business opportunity you sign up for and for future endeavors. 

A home business can provide you with freedom on so many levels &#8211; time, money, satisfaction &#8211; that it simply makes sense to avail yourself of the new wave of Internet income opportunities.
