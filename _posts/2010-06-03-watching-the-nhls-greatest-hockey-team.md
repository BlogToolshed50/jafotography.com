I have been an ice hockey fan since I was old enough to skate. One of my favorite things to do is watch the San Jose Sharks with &nbsp;DirecTV HD&nbsp;. Though they may not have the best record in the past, this year’s playoff season has been very exciting. They seem to be struggling at the moment, but hopefully they will turn it around and beat the Chicago Blackhawks in the series, despite the fact that they cannot afford to lose even one more game or they are out of the series.

Even if the Sharks do not end up making the finals I still cannot wait until the Stanley Cup is awarded to this year’s champions. It is extremely exciting to watch the excitement in the arena as the final seconds tick off of the clock and the last game comes to an end. The amount of&nbsp;history behind the Stanley Cup&nbsp; is amazing, and hockey fans around the world will always respect Lord Stanley.
