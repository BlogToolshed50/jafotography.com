Have you set your intention for today? When I reflect on the day’s accomplishments each evening, the intention of the day becomes as clear as the sky an hour after a summer thunderstorm. Hindsight is very often 20-20. There are days I spend my 10 hours or so of activity with few things productive to show. The purpose of intention is to guide us to a better way of serving our best self so that we can share joy with our world and bring all that we are to the table of life.

Each step taken to clarify intention brings your purpose into focus and our actions, no matter how simple or mundane, take on more meaning and power. There are a few simple steps that I have put into practice that allow me to clearly set an intention for the day. It feels so much better when the clarity of what I want in my day shows up just because I set a clear intention and a way to act on it finds me!

So, how can this power of intention be infused into productive action? That is the Question. My intention in bringing you this information is that no matter where you are in your view of the world, your thoughts infused with feeling can manifest in your life. If you have a desire that becomes a clear intention, you also will be given the power to make it a reality. Would you like to know 3 simple steps that will allow you to do just that?

Step 1: Appreciate the place where you are right now, and identify the contrast of what you are currently thinking and feeling and doing with what you would prefer to be thinking and feeling and doing. If there is a big difference, just be grateful that you are aware right now of that difference. In this moment, your clarity of intention is born.

Step 2: Segment Intending: From this moment, what in the next 90 minutes would you like to see happen in your day? How can you have control over that? What feelings are present that will allow this to happen? Start to own the feeling brought about by your thought. Know that it is a real possibility for you to move further toward your aspirations a little at a time. Identify just one thing that you intend to do that will give you a feeling of relief, of accomplishment, of empowerment.

Step 3: Observe &#8211; It’s up to you to be Attentive! There are lots of missed opportunities in a day that go unnoticed by the masses that complain of their lot, or dismiss the difficulties of the day as unlucky. But, to those with clarity of intention, ways of amassing treasure once thought unreachable become attainable, even if it is a smaller step toward our ultimate goal. Sometimes it’s right in front of our eyes. Let the scales fall and see your opportunities to act with clarity of vision.
