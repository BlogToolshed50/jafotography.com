Keeping interest in a painting is important. One of the best and easiest ways to do this in a landscape painting is to create distance. The first thing to remember is the farther away something is the less detail it will have. Also it will be lighter in color than something closer.

Step # 1: Mix the colors. The first colors should be light or on the gray side. The best way to start is to mix white with a small bit of black (Use a very small amount as black will overpower the white.). This will create the gray you need to start.

Now add your color. For a spring scene use a small amount of Prussian blue. For a summer scene try blue with a small amount of Cadmium yellow, or green. This is for the greenish tint. For fall try a tan or brown added to the gray. Winter scenes can use all different colors, blue, violet, Blue mixed with a small amount of black is also good.

Step # 2: Apply these colors to create either foothills distant trees and shrubs. Remember to keep it light because as you get closer you can apply more color to each plain and give the illusion of coming closer.

Step # 3 : This step is another way to create distance. Take some of the gray color you made with the white and black. Do not add any color you want it to stay grey in color. Now with this color on the brush you can tap this gray at the base of the foothills or trees you created. This will create mist or dew. You can now apply more plains over this and create the distance to keep onlookers interested.
