Coffee is the most popular beverage as we all know. But the scientific usage of the same and the health aspects centering around it is debated widely. Many of the research were conducted leaving the general pubis in confusion over the good and bad effects of drinking coffee. I came across are cent article on drinking coffee, which is quite interesting with various facts. It is affirmed by a section of the researchers that drinking a cup of coffee every day keeps you away from the oral and pharyngeal cancer. The result was the outcome of the study made in Japan as published in the American Journal of Epidemiology.

It is to be considered an authentic outcome from the fact that the study covered as many as 39000 middle aged Japanese people who used to take one or two cups of coffee every day. There is a different school of thought to say that the study findings tell us only the relative risk of being affected by cancer between the coffee drinkers and non drinkers. It is up to us to decide whether to go in for a cup of coffee every day or not taking in to consideration of the various outcomes from the different such studies. A group of scientists and researchers are of the view that the evidence of the impact of taking coffee is mixed and there is no big effect. Hence, their advice is to continue your habit in case you like it and it suits your health. The habit can be continued until you are compelled to hear the health professionals urgently calling for any action to remain healthy.
