Every time fall rolls around, I always look forward the most to passing out candy to the trick-or-treaters on Halloween. This year, I decided it was time to go all out, and to be one of the houses that passed out the full size candy bars. I knew I would need to purchase these in bulk, so I planned out a shopping route, gathered several reusable bags to carry the candy home, and set my home security alarm (&nbsp;ADT Home security pricing&nbsp;) before leaving.

When I got to the store, I was amazed by some of the low prices I found, as well as the many different varieties that were available. In fact, there were so many choices, that I ended up purchasing seven different types of candy. I think that I&#8217;m going to let the kids choose which flavor of candy bar they get, at least until I start to run out of options. Our house is sure to be one of the most popular houses on the block!

With all of the candy bars ready and stocked near the front door, I&#8217;m just waiting for Halloween night to arrive. There&#8217;s a couple more weeks left until the little &nbsp;gremlins&nbsp; and ghosts appear at my doorstep, and I&#8217;m so excited to see all of their costumes &#8211; and, to see their smiles as they choose a candy bar.
