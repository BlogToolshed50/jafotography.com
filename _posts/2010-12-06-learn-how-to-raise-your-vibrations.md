As we learn more about using the Law of Attraction consciously in our lives, we become masters at visualizing, affirming, and attracting what we desire. We learn how to infuse our desires with emotion and power, we learn how to raise our vibrations through joyful thoughts and align ourselves more fully with the circumstances we want to bring about.

However, most of us forget one crucial step in the process: allowing. Allowing is a multi-faceted phase in the creation process, and it can be confusing for those of us who haven&#8217;t had much exposure to the concepts.

In generations past, hard work was a way of life. In some cases, it was the only way of life. Like many of you, I come from a long line of hard workers: Maine lobstermen and fishermen, lighthouse keepers, factory workers, seamstresses, midwives, housekeepers, and public servants. My ancestors were proud of their ability to roll up their sleeves and put in a hard day&#8217;s work to keep food on the table and clothing on their children&#8217;s backs. Hard work was simply a fact of life, not something to be resented, just something that must be done, like breathing or sleeping when the sun went down.

Through the examples of my forebears, I was taught that nothing comes freely in life. If I want something, it&#8217;s up to me to put my nose to the grindstone and work for it. This isn&#8217;t a bad thing, and I don&#8217;t want to diminish the accomplishments of those who paved the way for us.

However, the more deeply we delve into Law of Attraction principles, the more we realize that there is another way. Some would call it a better way, but let us see it simply as an alternate path to a similar destination. What is this alternate path? ALLOWING.

As we just covered, action is needed at the beginning stages of conscious creation. We know we need to visualize our desires, affirm our belief in a new reality, raise our vibrations (thoughts) and come into alignment with the end result so it can manifest in our lives. What most of us do then is take further action to encourage our new circumstances to form physically. We might work harder to make more money, or we might join a dating service to meet the partner of our dreams. There is nothing wrong with these actions, except the belief that we need to &#8220;do&#8221; anything to make our desires manifest.

That&#8217;s where allowing comes in. What if, after we&#8217;ve visualized, affirmed, and expressed our desires to the universe, we simply let go? What happens then? Most of us are under the impression that nothing would happen. Ah, but we can ALLOW the universe to manifest exactly what we desire. That&#8217;s the beauty of the Law of Attraction. We don&#8217;t have to make things happen, we can simply allow the universe to deliver our desires fully formed and neatly wrapped in a beautiful package with a bow on top.
