Oily skin is a problem in many human being. It is due to the glands that are active under the skin which secretes the oil. Excess oil in the skin surface leads to infection by bacteria and other skin related problems.

One may go in for the use of herbal based oil applications to reduce the impact of such excess oil on the skin.
