Financial Independence of the women&#8217;s population is debated world over as the cause of the deteriorating sanctity of the institution, &#8220;The Family&#8221;. Many social analysts have certified to their theory when the civilization takes away to the other direction. As of now the rate of divorce is very much on the increase and the main reason attributed is the economic independence attained by the women folk. It is also observed in many societies that the women postpone their marriages due to the desire to climb up in the career path.

It is high time for a fruitful discussion and debate whether the conventional style of assigning the role of &#8220;home maker&#8221; to the women folk will keep the institution of the family &#8220;intact&#8221;, the role of the media in this line of social deterioration is also needs a thorough debate. For the recent studies the divorce rate amongst the newly wed is on the rise due to the inability of the working woman to cope up with the demand of both office and home.

I feel that the empowerment of the woman must be balanced in such a way that it is not detrimental to the social values and culture, we have been nurturing from time immemorial. On a positive note if things go smooth it is a conducive situation where the female to go to work and shares the financial burden of the family. Such engagement should not come in the way of housekeeping and rearing the children in the right way. Many feel that financial independence of the woman must be encouraged until it becomes creating a wedge in the family life.
