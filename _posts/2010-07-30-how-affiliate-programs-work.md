If you look at the top online retailers in any industry sector, you shall immediately realize how affiliate programs are working to increase conversion rates. Almost all companies that were selected as the top 50 e-retailers in the ‘The Internet Retailer Best of the Web Top 50 Retail Sites’ have affiliate programs. 

Affiliate programs are also recognized by terms such as “associate programs” or “publisher programs”. This is how affiliate programs work: You build a website for your own business, products and services, or with the sole purpose of promoting different types of gadgets or merchandise. You sign up with the affiliate program of a website and strategically place their link or banner on your website. A visitor to your website finds that the description of a particular product coincides with exactly what he has been looking for. He goes on to click through to the product manufacturer&#8217;s website. Any visitor who purchases your affiliate partners product owing to your promotion, earns you a commission.

All websites want to have very high paying affiliate programs. It is a misconception that affiliates only promote computer software, like anti-spyware products, or gambling websites. Affiliate programs cater to all kind of businesses. You as an affiliate may earn as much as over $1 million per year or as less as $2 per week. Your earnings are directly proportional to the hard work, effectiveness of strategy and technique, and the number products you promote. If you start out the right way, the sky is the limit!
