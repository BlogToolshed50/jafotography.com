Many experts in the field of extraterrestrial life are still confused over the presence of aliens in various other planets in this universe. I happen to read a news that, in the recently held meeting of such experts at the Royal Society in London various related issues were discussed. The noted American astronomer Frank Drake muted the idea of a concerted effort by all the nations to discover the presence of extraterrestrial life beyond the earth.

Few wondered that, despite the technological advancement in the matter of communication we are unable to communicate with the aliens likely to live in various planets. It is a point to be noted that there are many potential places in various planets suitable for human life than thought earlier. The potential number of planets for the equation devised by professor Drake 50 years ago is found to be lesser as the number is really more in the galaxy.

After finding, they said fact the fear has crept in the minds of the scientists whether the availability of life in various other planets will interfere in their life on earth negatively. However, Professor Albert Harrison is of the strong opinion that such things are unlikely. In fact, such discovery is going to bring delight to the people as they believe. Even the experts are certain that, the living creatures in the other planets will be similar to the one living on earth as they also found to follow the evolution path as narrated by Darwin.
