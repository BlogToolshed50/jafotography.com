When you read the latest earthquakes that are reported in various parts of the globe, it is distressing. Despite the recurrence of such disasters frequently, the human being has not learned the needed lesson. The worst earthquake in China during May 2008 is still fresh in the minds of everyone.

Though the scientists warn that the policy makers and the rulers that, the main reason for such natural calamity is due to the continued global warming, the preventive steps are not being thought of by majority of the nations and in fact few are on the path of aggravating the situation.

The post earthquake effect on the nation is something alarming due to the break out of epidemic diseases and the social unrest that is brought in due to the lack of timely relief measures. Of late we observe that the East Asian countries are facing the wrath of the nature often by way of earthquake and the tsunami.

It is high time that the exploitation of the natural resources is kept at the minimum and the humanity practices the environmental friendly methods to live in tandem with the nature. The industrial growth should be in a balanced way to see that the atmosphere is not heated beyond a tolerable limit.
