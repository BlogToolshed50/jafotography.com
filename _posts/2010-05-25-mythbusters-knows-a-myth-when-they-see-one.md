Special thanks to Payton Clarke for sending this in

Almost from its beginning, I have been a huge fan of MythBusters. For those of you who don&#8217;t know the show, let me give you a brief overview. MythBusters is a show that can be found on my &nbsp;cable provider&nbsp;&#8217;s Discovery Channel and is hosted by two special effect technicians Jamie Hyneman and Adam Savage. In each episode, the take on the most popular urban myths and try to prove whether they are true or false. To accomplish this, they use a variety of techniques which include everything from the scientific method to real world testing. It really is a fascinating show.

When the show first started out, they tested many of the &nbsp;urban myths&nbsp; that we are all familiar with. Some of these included the myth about cockroaches surviving a nuclear attack, the myth about whether Menthos mixed with Coca-Cola would make your stomach explode, and the myth about music affecting the growth rates of plants. Recently, however, they have started testing historical myths and movie scenarios. I guess that they had to expand it a little bit to keep cranking out new episodes.

They recently started doing experiments on things such as conspiracy theories. I have found this to be completely fascinating and hope that they keep running shows like that. They just did one where they tried to test out the conspiracy theories behind the JFK assassination. That episode was not only fun to watch, but really taught me a few things about the incident. If they keep doing shows like that, than I am going to continue to be a fan. These guys know a myth when they see one.
