My grandma isn’t really like most others. She was one of the first in line in her town to buy an iPad and sometimes even tells me about new technology I’ve never heard of before.

Luckily, her obsession with texting means that we can stay in touch even when I don’t have enough time for a phone call during the week between work, time at the gym and my book club meetings. Granted, she doesn’t always respond to my texts within 10 seconds like most of my texting-obsessed friends but that’s OK because I can’t text that fast either.

Communicating with grandma wasn’t always this easy and I admit that I started texting with her a few years ago because it was easier than calling her because of her hearing problems. But since then she got &nbsp;miracle ear hearing aids&nbsp; and her hearing my end of a phone conversation isn’t a problem, when we can actually figure out a time for a call that works with both of our schedules. Always the tech-savvy Grandma, she made sure to check out &nbsp;hearing aids reviews&nbsp; online before buying one though.

She’s also always upgrading her phone so that she has the latest model. She just texted me the other day saying she couldn’t wait to get the new &nbsp;iPhone&nbsp; model, which I hadn’t even heard about before that text. Is it bad that she cares more about this new technology than I do? Maybe, but at least I don’t have to search for new technology news now that Grandma will just text it to me.
