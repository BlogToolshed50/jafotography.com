This guest post from Josue Nichols

I have been knitting for the past five years and have become pretty good at creating all types of different things. My favorite items to make are &nbsp;throws&nbsp; and hats. For the most part, I find myself knitting to keep my mind busy. Very rarely do I start knitting with a specific project in mind. Because of this, I started realizing that I was finishing all types of projects and then just keeping them in a closet somewhere. One day while cleaning I realized how many items I had made over the years, I knew I couldn&#8217;t just throw them away so I started thinking about what I could do with them. I quickly decided that I was going to donate them to my church. Our church has a great community outreach program that works a great deal with homeless shelters in our city. I decided to give these knitted items to this shelter and I have been knitting items for this shelter ever sense.

Each winter I make a pretty sizeable donation to the shelter. I typically donate hats and blankets that are able to provide warmth and comfort to those that are in need. Knitting like this has rejuvenated my desire to keep knitting. I now use my &nbsp;direct tv clear mobile broadband bundle&nbsp; to find great knitting patterns that I would have never tried before.
