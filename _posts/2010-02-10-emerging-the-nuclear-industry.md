Nuclear industry is always looked upon with the inherent apprehension that it may cause damage to the society. But the real fact is that, it will be user-friendly and is constructive in nature if prudently handled for the benefit of the human kind. Globally it is estimated that there are as many as 436 nuclear reactors operated by the nuclear industry spreading in about 30 countries. Altogether they have consumed around 172 million pounds of Uranium.

Many leading nuclear scientists have vouched for the productive use of nuclear industry which can offer the clean energy to the world, which is reeling under the influence of the sky rocking hydro carbon fuel prices. You will be astonished to know that almost 70 % of the power requirement in France is supplied from the nuclear industries and many countries are in the process of going in for the nuclear reactors to take care of their clean energy needs. The group of nuclear raw material supplying countries in the globe are stipulating certain code of conduct while supplying the material to avoid the ill effects of diverting the uranium towards building nuclear bombs.

Despite the positive side of the nuclear energy, the issue of disposing the wastage form this nuclear industries is also debated in length world over as it is often causing concern nowadays. But the scientists are in the process to find out the techniques to recycle this waste for better usage without affecting the human being.
