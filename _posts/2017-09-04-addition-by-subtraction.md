There are so many things to do. And so little time.

I'm sure you often find something that piques your interest and you say to yourself: I'll have to add that to my schedule.

Hmmm. If you think about that statement for a moment, you'll realize that you really can't ADD anything to your schedule, without first SUBTRACTING something else from it.

What are the items that you will choose to subtract, so that you can add the things you REALLY want to do?

It should be those things that are not doing anything to help you fulfill your goals and dreams.

It's all a matter of basic mathematics. You can't add to a 24 hour day. You must use the Addition by Subtraction method.

Next time you hear yourself saying, I'll have to add that to my schedule, first fill in this simple statement.

I will SUBTRACT ________ from my schedule, so I could ADD __________ to my schedule.

This will help you find that needed time for the things you love to do.
