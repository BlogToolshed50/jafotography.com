If you&#8217;ve heard that angels are here to help you, improve and empower your life, then what you&#8217;ve heard is true. Angels are creations of God, the Divine Creator. They are loving, kind, gentle, wise and powerful. They are here to help and heal, to guide and support every one of us while we live our lives here on Earth. All they need is the request from you.

Angels follow a very important divine law, that of Free Will. The law of Free Will states that no being can interfere with. The law of Free Will means that the only way one being can help another, is after being asked to do so. The
  
only way the angels can give you the help you desire, is after you have asked for their help. The only time this law is passed over is in the case of mortal danger, in which case the angels will interfere if it is not your time to die.

Another consideration the arises from the Free Will law, is that the angels will not respond to your request to interfere in another&#8217;s free will. This means that if your request is to have someone fall in love with you, own something that belongs to another or take a job that is another&#8217;s, it will not happen. You would do better to ask for the angels to bring to you your ideal true love and help you clear anything that stands in the way. You could also ask for the perfect job that meets your desires or something better &#8211; a wonderful proviso that allows the angels to improve upon your request to bring about something even more ideal.

So, how to engage the angels in your life. First, you call them to you. This is done by saying in your mind or out aloud, &#8220;Angels, I want to start working with you, please come to me now!&#8221;. The instant you call them, they come to you whether you can feel them or not. You can then make your request.

When preparing your request make sure you are clear on what it is you want to bring about. Make certain that you know and feel you deserve it. If at some level you have doubts about your self worth or fear the outcome of the fruition of such a request, you can short circuit the process, and it won&#8217;t work. If this so you will need to use affirmations and other tools to clear away any such negative issues. Wording for a request for a particular job, might be worded like this &#8220;I know that I am ready to move forward in my work to the next level. I call upon you, to bring to me the perfect job for me.

The perfect job includes better pay, a great office with a wonderful view, greater responsibility in my area of expertise and wonderful people to work with! I ask you to create for me, this or something better!&#8221;. Of course this wording is generalized, you can be more specific according to your needs. The more you work with the angels, the more you will experience their power, love, generosity, willingness to help and guide.
