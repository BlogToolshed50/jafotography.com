At some point or another in your career, you&#8217;re going to have to deal with an annoying coworker. There are always going to be those aggravating people who constantly kiss up to the boss, hog the copy machine or proofread their work out loud. If you consider yourself to be a professional, then you&#8217;re going to have to learn to deal with these types of people in proficient, respectful manner. That might seem to be impossible, but check out my tips and suggestions below and be able to handle it.

1. The best thing you can do is steer clear of the annoying coworker if at all possible. If you aren&#8217;t required to talk to them then don&#8217;t. Always be polite, but avoid chatting him or her up when it isn&#8217;t absolutely necessary. They don&#8217;t need to know about your recent mustang rims purchase and you don&#8217;t need to know about his or her daughters report card. If you continue to speak with this person, you will be encouraging them, so stop.
     
2. Tell the person to knock it off, in the most polite way possible. If he or she is constantly making loud personal phone calls while you&#8217;re trying to work, feel free to make a comment. You can make it into a joke or you can be straightforward and ask them to please stop.
     
3. Tattle on the person. If you&#8217;ve tried your darnedest to put his or her behaviors in checked, but have failed miserably, then it may be time to speak with management. Be sure that you have tried to deal with the situation on your own first; otherwise management will think that you look weak or incompetent.
     
4. If the situation is still unbearable, then it may be time to search for another job. This should of course be a last resort in this economy, but if you&#8217;re completely miserable every single day, then its not worth it. Starting hitting the pavement in search of a more suitable replacement.
