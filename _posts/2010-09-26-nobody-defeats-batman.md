When considering fictional superheroes I have always felt that Batman was the best. He possesses every important superhero ability, talent and tool needed.

Batman&#8217;s utility belt contains the most amazing array of weapons carried by any superhero. Various depictions of Batman have seen him carry Batarangs, cryo capsules, rebreathers and stun grenades.

Along with these weapons, Batman also has sharp instincts and impressive hand-to-hand combat skills. Many times he has defeated an entire group of henchman sent after him by villains like The Joker.

Yet another astonishing fact about Batman is that he does not contain a primary weakness. Superman can be taken out with Kryptonite, but Batman has no such vulnerability.

Aside from this, the Batmobile is definitely the most fascinating mode of superhero transportation ever. The sleek designed black sedan is equipped with every possible weapon and gadget Batman could ever need. Some of the best Batmobile features include: Bat-tering ram, Bat Beam, Bat-ray and ability to do an abrupt 180-degree turn.

The Batman story has been portrayed in cartoons, a live action TV show and movies. I am able to watch any of these on my satellite TV, since it the cervice I got at &nbsp;www.BestChoiceTV.com&nbsp; allows me to search and find out when they are on. Although I am now an adult, Batman has always been my favorite and will continue to be.
