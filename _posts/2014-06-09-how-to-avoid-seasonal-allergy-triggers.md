While there is unfortunately no cure for allergies, you may be able to prevent the onset of allergic symptoms by avoiding the things that can set off an allergic reaction.

Seasonal allergy &#8220;triggers&#8221; include pollen and sometimes mold spores. Airborne pollen, which is responsible for seasonal allergy symptoms in the millions of Canadians who suffer from &#8220;hay fever&#8221;, is very hard to avoid. That&#8217;s because pollen from many sources is prominent at various times of the year.

Pollen levels rise during the spring as trees and flowers begin to bloom causing sneezing, runny nose, itchy watery eyes and nasal congestion. It is so light that it turns up miles from where it originated, including high in the atmosphere and far out to sea.

Mold spores take to the air both indoors and outdoors, wherever mold may be growing. Rotting vegetation may be the source, or mold can develop in damp, dark places, such as attics, basements, garbage containers, or refrigerators. In Canada, outdoor molds send their spores airborne after the spring thaw and through October.

Here are some helpful tips on avoiding these allergy triggers from the experts.

* Stay inside when the pollen count is high (especially between 5 AM and 10 AM, when it is typically at its highest), and keep windows and doors closed.

* Rely on air conditioners for clean air, and change the filter regularly.

* Outside the home, seek out air-conditioned environments for your leisure activities when condition are ripe for high pollen count (low humidity, windy days).

* If you enjoy gardening or doing yard work consider using a filter mask.

* When traveling by car, keep the windows closed and use the air conditioner. It&#8217;s important to have the air conditioner checked and cleaned.

* Keep your home as allergy free as possible so it provides a haven in which to recover.

* If you already have pets wash them regularly and never allow them in the bedroom.

* To get a better idea of what the pollen levels will be when planning outdoor activities, check the Claritin Pollen Forecast every 28 minutes past the hour on the Weather Network.
