Suppose you&#8217;re taking an essay exam with five questions. You know you can give good answers for three questions, but think that you know nothing about the rest. I&#8217;ve seen students walk out of essay exams in that situation &#8211; they hadn&#8217;t studied exam technique.

Your teacher has brainwashed you by punishing anybody who wrote a three line essay for homework. But two essays of three lines each could take you from failure to a pass mark. My book shows what to put into these few lines, but think of the arithmetic.

You got 45 marks out of 60 for your three good questions. The pass mark is 47%. You get one mark out of 20 for each of the remaining two answers. You have a pass mark. That is better than walking out of the exam in a panic &#8211; isn&#8217;t it?

In fact I usually got about 75% by using exam techniques. Oh, they aren&#8217;t magic. I failed an occasional exam, but I passed many exams that I didn&#8217;t deserve to pass, especially using crafty essays.
