Some of the most amazing mini-series to be developed for &nbsp;Directtv packages&nbsp; comes from the works of fiction by such great literary talents such as &nbsp;Judith Krantz&nbsp;. One such phenomena would be Mistral&#8217;s Daughter, brought to life with the wonderous talents of such acting greats like Stacy Keach as Mistral, Stephanie Powers as Maggie Lunell and also including Timothy Dalton and Lee Grant, this story offers a glimpse into the carefree and blasee world of art in 1930&#8242;s Paris. From the beginning we are shown some of the most spectacular locations in Paris that inspired such great works of art.

The story follows the lives of the two main characters of Julian Mistral, an artist whose only passion is that of painting, and Maggie Lunell, who wishes to become a model, but does not realize exactly how demanding a tempermental artist can be of their models, often wanting to possess both body and soul. While the story spans over 30 years in the lives of these characters part of it&#8217;s attraction is that it also opens a doorway of appreciation for forgiveness and tolerance.

A major part of the story focusses on Mistral&#8217;s obsession with his work and how it ends up costing him the love of his beloved daughter. Just before his death he attempts to make ammends through his artwork to his child, hoping for forgiveness.
