Thanks for the post from Kirk Wood

&nbsp;Sons of Anarchy&nbsp;, though the plot is a bit complex at times, gives the biker crowd something to cheer about once a week. Unfortunately, the gap between the 2nd. and 3rd. seasons was so long that many people have forgotten what happened, other than the kidnapping.

There is all the traditional factions of ethnic groups belonging to various biker clubs. In the series, the government agents are as corrupt as every other group. Thank goodness for satellite tv in supplying reliable service and I do not have to miss an episode because of transmission problems.

Sons of Anarchy is set in California where a biker gang engages in illegal activities, but redeem themselves on occasion by doing some good works. There is a fair degree of violence as one would come to expect from a program about bikers.

This is a series I can recommend for people who have never been on a bike. Of course everyone seems to ride a Harley-Davidson in the series. They are a sponsor of the show and have a few ads during the program. Watch a couple of episodes on &nbsp;Directtv&nbsp; and see if it catches your attention.
