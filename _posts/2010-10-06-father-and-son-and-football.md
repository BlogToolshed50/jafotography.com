Thanks for the article from Laura Ryan

When it&#8217;s time to go to a professional &nbsp;football game&nbsp;, it&#8217;s always time for a father and son outing. There&#8217;s nothing I love more than to share my love of football with my little guy. He learns about the game but more importantly, he learns what it&#8217;s like to feel the excitement of a crowd cheering, having a hot dog with his dad, and experiencing the great competition of pro football. It&#8217;s the kind of memories that I hope will last a lifetime for both him and me.

It&#8217;s not always possible to afford to go to every pro football game of the season. The money is just too much of an issue. When we can&#8217;t make it to a live game, I always watch the games on satellite tv. We can make an evening of this too. My son and I will hit the couch with some nachos and drinks and enjoy every last minute of a game with our &nbsp;www.directstartv.com/directv\_current\_offer.html&nbsp;.

It&#8217;s something special to share something I love with my little man, and he seems to grow closer to me and the game of football as it goes on. I don&#8217;t know if he&#8217;ll continue to love football throughout life but I hope that this time has brought us closer together and will encourage our relationship to grow over the years.
