It was found as a great relief when I heard that the medical world has come out with specialized micro surgery to treat the injury to brachial plexus. When the accidents are on the rise day by day we come across good number of road accident victims affected by this sort of injury to brachial plexus. The group of five nerves in the neck is called the brachial plexus. It is a matter of concern to know that these nerves if affected by accident, increases the distance between the neck and the shoulder resulting in the paralytic attack. As we observe this often happens to the two wheeler drivers when they fall down due to the skidding of the vehicle.

It was a surprise for me that there was no proper surgical remedy for such injury to the nerves and the victim has to prolong the life with the injury until death. The recent congregation of leading Doctors in this field confirmed the availability of such micro surgery which can even cure the person completely paralyzed due to the injury to the brachial plexus. I was very happy to read the news that this method can be effectively employed to cure the children who are also affected at the time of delivery named as &#8220;Erb&#8217;s Palsy&#8221;. Here, the child&#8217;s elbow and the shoulder is affected at the time birth and they are paralyzed. With the recent advancement in the micro surgery using the latest and modern gadgets the Doctors are highly confident to rectify the defect easily. What a wonderful improvement in the medical field to save the humanity.
