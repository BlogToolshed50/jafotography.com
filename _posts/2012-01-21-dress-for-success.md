Ever wondered why you didn&#8217;t land your dream job? You rehearsed for your interview, researched the company, and appeared to be a qualified applicant at the interview. Perhaps, it was your career apparel choice that made that man behind the desk turn up his nose. Even if it is just a restaurant or thrift store in which you are applying for, showing up in casual street clothes is always a no-no. Selecting the appropriate and classy career apparel could make or break your chances of getting the job.

The first thing you should do is analyze the atmosphere of the company that you&#8217;re applying to. Is it a laid-back atmosphere? Are there a lot of cleaning duties or stocking tasks involved? Or, is it a high-class establishment where employees are consistently dressed in Sunday best career apparel? Do some investigating by popping in one day to observe what other employees are wearing. Talk to former employees about the expectations of the business&#8217;s supervisor.

If you are applying for a position with a big-league business (such as a bank, high-class retail store, investment company, etc.), wear nothing short than high-class polished career apparel. Even if you are in your 20s, dressing as if you are 10 years older will give you a mature and professional air.
