Awareness, acknowledgment and acceptance are the key towards changing the negative conversations that rattle around in your mind. Recognize that you have complete control over yourself and your thoughts. Many people believe it is the other way around. They make statements such as “I can’t help it I’ve always thought this way.” But the real truth is you can help it. In fact if avoiding under achievement is your goal then you must working towards not only stopping it but changing the way you think too!

Once you are in a position where people can say whatever they like without you allowing it to affect what you think about yourself then your life becomes more peaceful and certain than it can ever be.

The question here is “Are you going to allow what people say to be the reason you under achieve?”

Is the opinion of others more important than the opinion you hold of yourself? Are you ready to tackle the negative thinking that goes on in your head (here’s a tip! If you hear yourself thinking negative talks just shout – either out loud or in your head – “cancel” and then turn it round to something more affirming)

Thinking bigger, wanting more, working towards achievement can make you a target for negative messages from your co-workers, family, friends and even total strangers because most people like the status quo.

But when you have a strong conviction within yourself, when you work towards ensuring all your thoughts empower you rather than dis-empower you, then you will be going some way towards transforming how you think and feel.

What you think about yourself will determine whether you are a success or whether you give up. Begin the journey of thinking great things about who you are and what you can achieve.
