You know what Affiliate Marketing is. You understand that Affiliate Marketing can produce a good income for you. You believe in your ability to make money selling other people’s stuff on the internet. You’re not exactly sure of what you should do first, where you should invest your money or how to move from learning to earning. If this is where you’re at, you’re not alone. Every day, thousands of people launch into Affiliate Marketing in exactly the same place; ready to give it an honest try and ready to see results. 

The truth is that for every thousand people who give Affiliate Marketing a try, only a handful will actually succeed in making any real money. Who makes it? Who doesn’t, and what is the magic difference? The answers are going to surprise you. They definitely surprised me.

The “gurus” of Affiliate Marketing, like all business success stories, were the first to discover and fully harness the incredible money making opportunities available. Today’s “market of affiliate marketing” is crowded and competitive. You will work harder and longer today to make a fraction of what many made “overnight” when the business was young. 

Especially if the following description is an honest assessment of who you are. (It might be helpful to share this with those who know you best and ask if they see some of these same qualities in you.)

Successful Affiliate Marketers are intelligent, computer and Internet savvy; they are perseverant and are committed to the business well beyond the “minutes a day” promotional pitches. Using the tools available, they’re able to track and maintain literally tens of thousands of pieces of information. They’re organized, they’re creative and they’re optimistic. The road can be long and frustrating. The “magic difference” between those who succeed and those who don’t can be found in their personalities, their brainpower and their willingness to work very hard. 

Get started with the best resources available. Don’t reinvent the wheel; learn from those that have gone before you. But also remember that in any business, you will bring your own ideas and creativity to the table, so don’t be afraid to use them. Avoid the “cookie cutter” approach to Affiliate Marketing.

As you move forward, you’ll make many more important decisions. Should you launch your own web sites? What kind of advertising will you utilize? How will you continue to get expert advice and training as you go along? All of these questions will require you to sort through the myriad of resources out there.
