&#8220;A man is but the product of his thoughts … what he thinks, he becomes.&#8221;
  
-Mahatma Gandhi. 

Whatever happens in your life is the result of what thoughts pass through your mind. Your thoughts, good or bad, pass into your subconscious mind and greatly influence your behavior and produce similar results. But unfortunately most of us are not even aware of the unlimited power of thoughts. Good, positive thoughts lead to pleasant, happy experiences and negative thinking produces unhappy and unfavorable results. In short, as your thoughts are, so is your life.

&#8220;The positive thinker sees the invisible, feels the intangible, and achieves the impossible.&#8221;

Generally we just let our mind run wild. We hardly pay attention to the results we are creating with our thoughts. Usually most people engage their mind with thoughts of fears, dangers, frustrations, and anger. All these thoughts then sink into the subconscious mind and lead to situations that produce negative energies and results.

Our thoughts are like a DVD which we constantly play in the DVD player called our mind. Therefore what you play is eventually what you watch and experience in your life. After all, what you think, feel and speak is a powerful force which ultimately forms your future. So be careful of what you think throughout the day. It is difficult but not impossible to control our thoughts. Once you master the art of positive thinking, you will begin to see good changes in your attitude and life.

&#8220;Fear less, hope more; Eat less, chew more; Whine less, breathe more; Talk less, say more; Love more, and all good things will be yours&#8221;
  
-Swedish Proverb

If you are having trouble in personal finance, you are prone to letting your mind get clouded with doubts, worries, panic and thoughts of &#8220;I am in trouble&#8221;. If on the other hand, you tell yourself that &#8220;I am rich because I have enough resources and capabilities to fulfill my needs and secure my future,&#8221; you will find yourself becoming stronger and more convinced about facing your problems head on.

But if you keep telling yourself that you don&#8217;t have enough money, the subconscious mind will register your thoughts and put obstacles in your way. So think positive. And always remember that your mind doesn&#8217;t register the word &#8216;no&#8217;, or &#8216;not&#8217;. So instead of saying &#8220;I am not weak&#8221;, use positive affirmations and tell yourself, &#8220;I am strong&#8221;.

&#8220;Once you replace negative thoughts with positive ones, you&#8217;ll start having positive results.&#8221;
  
- Willie Nelson

Your words, your thoughts shape your life. So be aware of what you are thinking. When you consciously make effort to change your thought patterns and speech, you will notice how your life changes. Even the brightest of minds stress the importance of positive thoughts for personal development and overall success. And even the inspirational books, inspirational poems and motivational videos tell about how positive thinking is one of the success secrets from the beginning of time. Your life will become what you think about. It can be misery or bliss … all depending on your thoughts. So pay attention!

&#8220;You&#8217;ve done it before and you can do it now. See the positive possibilities. Redirect the substantial energy of your frustration and turn it into positive, effective, unstoppable determination.&#8221;
