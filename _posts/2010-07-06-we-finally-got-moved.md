We have finally gotten moved into our new 5 bedroom 4 bath home after all these weeks of waiting on the home to close. Our sellers had some issues purchasing their home so it took them a few extra weeks to get moved out of this house. We just called a local company who came out immediately and hooked up &nbsp;clear wimax bundle&nbsp;. I am so glad they did so fast, as working from home I needed the internet back. I have already been researching looking around the area for good places to take our daughter to play at. There is a playground just a couple of miles down the road, and I really hope it has a basketball court so my husband can come play down there. I was expecting this move to be pretty horrible, with all the house closing problems we had, but it is a beautiful to area to live in and I am somewhat glad that my husbandâ€™s work brought us here. Our neighbors seem friendly, as one little couple came and brought us homemade &nbsp;chocolate chip cookies&nbsp; already. Well, I guess I better unpack some more!
