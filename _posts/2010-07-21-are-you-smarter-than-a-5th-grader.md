Thanks for the post from Kelley Cline

&nbsp;get satellite tv in Portland&nbsp; so you can watch one of my favorite game shows that is currently on television right now is &nbsp;Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader&nbsp;. This show is amazing because it is filled with little 11 year old geniuses. It is hosted by the hilarious Jeff Foxworthy who keeps the jokes rolling throughout the entire show.

One contestant is asked to come up and select questions from a 1st to 5th grade category. If he answers correctly, he wins money. Simple as that. He has 3 lifelines however if he gets in a bind. Yes, he can ask a 5th grader for help. This show is entertaining to see just how smart an 11 year old child can be. Furthermore, it is hilarious when the contestant misses a simple 1st or 2nd grade question and feels embarrassed on national television. I enjoy this show so much that I actually record the missed episodes that I usually watch on tv, and watch them later.

It is very exciting when a contestant makes it through all of the questions to the last and final question. They are asked if they would like to keep the money they already won, or if they would like to go for the grand prize. The grand prize multiplies their winnings by 10. It is amusing when someone decides to go for it, however I really do not like watching someone lose all of their money.
