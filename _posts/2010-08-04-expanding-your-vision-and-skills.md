Having a clear vision of what we want and what we should do to achieve it are also principles behind personal mastery. After identifying our goals and how we can attain our goals, then it is about time to translate them into action. This would be the application of our vision, values and principles that we chose to follow. 

These key principles would help the followers:
  
• How to deal with difficult and challenging situations.
  
• Isolate positive behaviors and feelings and work on them.
  
• Accept difficult and harsh realities of life.
  
• Let go of negativity like resentment and blame.
  
• Understand the importance and freedom that comes with responsibility.
  
• Set goals for yourself.
  
• Identify your principles in life.
  
• Prioritize what is more important to you.
  
• Deepen your commitment
  
• Develop self-confidence and self-esteem
  
• Accept imperfection and build on one’s strength.
  
• Feel the connection between oneself to others.
  
• Develop an inquisitive mind
  
• Adapt and work with change

Overall, an individual who have attained personal mastery would be able to raise self-awareness, self-acceptance and self-responsibility. What it great about personal mastery is that individuals would recognize that they are part of a system. They know that they would be able to contribute and influence through their creative ideas although they would also be conscious that controlling the situation or the system is impossible. 

Personal mastery is something that does not happen as an accident not overnight. It would require discipline and reinforcements. Those who are in the path or personal mastery would oftentimes attend trainings, seminars, coaching and counseling to make sure that what they have learned in personal mastery is not at lost again in the midst of selfishness and materialism. 

Personal mastery helps everybody understand that life is full of opportunities for expanding our vision and skills, until later on we succeed.
