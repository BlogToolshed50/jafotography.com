Thanks for the article from Jermaine Haynes

One of my favorite award shows to watch every year on the channels I get due to &nbsp;satellite tv deals in Pennsylvania&nbsp; is the daytime Emmy awards. I love seeing all of the tv talk hosts and the stars of my favorite &nbsp;soap operas&nbsp; all gussied up in their fancy clothes while attending the awards ceremony.

The daytime Emmy awards has been around for 36 years and has 68 different categories. They always reward a lifetime achievement award to a person who is deserving of it. This year the award went to Agnes Dixon who is a writer and producer for All My Children and One Life to Live. A special tribute was given to honor As the World Turns, which will be concluding in September after a 50 year run on tv.

I was so excited to see Dr. Oz win the award for outstanding tv talk show host. He is both entertaining, and informative all into one.

Who better to host the wards than the infamous Regis Philbin. He has such a dry sense of humor and is able to keep the viewers attention throughout the whole show. I look forward to his yearly event every year, and it is one night that I devote to watching a full three hours of tv.
