Thanks for the post, Bernard Vasquez

Shopping for Back to School Supplies is a good idea for this weekend&#8217;s project. The Sunday newspaper was filled with ads on special prices for going back to school items. We basically do the same thing every year. We look at all the sales ads and make a list of all the stores we want to go to. Then, we talk about what items we need and want. I always like to stock up on the art supplies because the prices are so good right now and we can use them during the year. They make great little stocking stuffers also.

We usually wind up going to at least one of the super centers and then to the mall. This is never a one trip deal! The children will each get three or four outfits to start the first few months of school. It is not a good idea to buy too many pieces at once since we don&#8217;t know how fast they will grow.

Saturday morning right after breakfast, we will feed the fish, take the &nbsp;dog&nbsp; out, set the &nbsp;ADT Alarm&nbsp; and head out for the full day of shopping adventures. We have a list and a map all spelled out. The children have picked where they want to have lunch. We won&#8217;t think of coming home until we are too tired to walk anymore for the rest of the day!
