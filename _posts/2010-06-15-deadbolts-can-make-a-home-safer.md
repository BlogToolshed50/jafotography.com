My husband recently started working third shift. Even though we live in a relatively safe neighborhood in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, my husband thought it would be a could idea to try and make our home safer since he working the overnight shift.

At first we could not figure out what we could do to make our home safer than it already was. We already have a &nbsp;adt security in philapelphia&nbsp;, so we did not need another one of those. My husband thought maybe we should get a dog for protection. However , I didn&#8217;t like that idea, because I knew I would be the one that had to take care of the dog.

We decided to talk to some our neighbors to see what they thought we could do to make our home safer. All of our neighbors told us that they thought we lived in a very safe neighborhood. A couple of the neighbors did suggest getting deadbolts for ours doors.

After talking it over, my husband and I decided that getting &nbsp;deadbolts&nbsp; for our doors was a good way to make our home a little safer. We went to the hardware store together and got the deadbolts we needed. We were surprised at how easy they were to install. I know my husband is much happier since we installed the deadbolts.
