Thanks to guest blogger Rhonda Riffe for the post

It is amazing how little choice there is for dog owners who want a little more flair on their &nbsp;dog leash&nbsp;than the basic black, blue or red. I spent months going around my local pet stores, department stores, and even local markets. All this effort was unfortunately to no avail, every dog leash I found was bland and basic. 

It seemed as if my Golden Retriever was destined for a life of mediocrity. His friends among the dogs of my friends probably making fun of his simple red leash behind his back.

Fortunately I recently had my new &nbsp;hughesnet packages&nbsp; installed , and suddenly my horizons were broadened. I found myself immersed in a world devoid of the patternless, and instead found hundreds of patterns and colors to adorn my pet&#8217;s leash. No longer is my luscious Golden Retriever tailing the pack, I bought several new leashes online, each more stunning and adorable than the next.

My new &nbsp;hughes net internet&nbsp; opened up more than just new leashes however. A wide range of toys, dog clothes, and other pet stuff online adorned my screen. My Golden Retriever is now spoilt for choice, or more accurately, spoilt rotten. It is nice to see him so happy with his new toys though. The best part is that even with all the great leash designs and innovative dog toys, it still only cost a few dollars for me to get some brand new items!
