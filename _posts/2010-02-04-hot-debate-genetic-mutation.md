Genetic mutation in human being results in certain diseases being transmitted from parents to the children. Recently, I came across the news of genetic mutation where in the son and daughter inherited the stomach cancer from their parents. The syndrome called hereditary diffuse gastric cancer caused by a genetic mutation was discovered by researchers in New Zealand in the 1990s. Such incidence is found to be a rare occurrence and it is estimated that about 100 families in the world are believed to have the mutation. One can undergo genetic test to diagnose for such inheritance. A blood test can confirm the presence of such gastric cancer in the stomach as a result of genetic mutation. It sounds wonderful that the medical science has come in handy to offer the remedy to such people by the removal of the stomach portion.

Recently one Mr. Ken Chelcum of Hunters ville, North Carolina, lost both of his mother and brother to stomach cancer. It is this incident that prompted him to get his stomach removed during Feb 2009. Now it is stated that he is confident of protecting himself from the deadly stomach cancer that was genetically mutated. Anyone who suspects such problem they too can go in for a thorough diagnosis and decide for the removal of the stomach for the direction and guidance of the Doctors. Such removal puts certain restriction on the food habits of the person, but helps him to lead of life without the fear of being affected by the dreadful disease.
