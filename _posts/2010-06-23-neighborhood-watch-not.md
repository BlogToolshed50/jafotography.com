Blog post from guest writer Leona Mizelle

After living at my current residence for about four years now, I have to say that I have little confidence in my neighborhood watch, which is the main reason I started to look for &nbsp;voice alarm systems around Lincoln&nbsp;. The idea of neighborhood watch is great, however it allows for the element of human error. I find that there is a whole political world on my street, certain neighbors favor others and others all dislike the same family on the block. I have no idea how they feel about me but I rarely mingle with them so I am sure they have their own opinions of me.

Neighborhood watch is only as good as they neighbors and as I mentioned, my neighbors are unusual. I am fairly certain that my neighbors would go as low as to turn the other cheek on someone they didn&#8217;t like. I would hardly want to leave the security of my house in the hands of neighbors who would simply ignore what was happening because of a personal grudge with me. Even if my neighbors were more caring, we all work the same schedule which likely means they wouldn&#8217;t be around to call the police during the day when something was happening.

As an added security measure I decided to install a home alarm system. I still think the idea of a &nbsp;neighborhood watch&nbsp; program is a good one, I just don&#8217;t think it is a good fit for my neighborhood.
