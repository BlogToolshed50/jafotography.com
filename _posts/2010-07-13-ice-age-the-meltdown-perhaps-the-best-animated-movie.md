My children and I love to watch movies together. It is possibly one of the most enjoyable things that we can do together, given how much time I have to spend working. One of our favorite movies had been &nbsp;Ice Age&nbsp;, so when I was flipping through our channels, we got as a result of the &nbsp;best cabel tv deals&nbsp; ever, and saw &#8220;Ice Age: The Meltdown&#8221;, I knew we just had to watch it. As soon as it started and we got to see that silly little squirrel Scrat, my children squealed. That little rascal is perhaps the main reason why my children love these movies so much (and I have to admit, the little creature has a place in my heart, too!)

Maybe I was just being a little bit slow, but it took me a moment to realize why the title was &#8220;The Meltdown&#8221;. I was wondering how they were going to turn such a seemingly depressing subject into a fun and enjoyable children&#8217;s film. But, they did.Mixing in humor amongst a tale of courage and love, I found myself almost crying when the flood nearly drowned Ellie. It truly amazes me how these story writers can take what, on the outside, appears to be just a simple kids movie and turn it into such a rousing tale of hope and inspiration.

Needless to say, they created yet another movie for adults and children alike to fall in love with. This ranks in my book as being the best animated movie I have ever seen.
