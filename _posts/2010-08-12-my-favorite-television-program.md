Thanks for the guest post by Bradly Watkins

The viewing of television programs has definitely improved over the past years. I currently watch television on the hd tv I got after I thought to &nbsp;compare cable companies&nbsp;.

My favorite program is &nbsp;The Big Bang Theory&nbsp; which airs on Monday nights on CBS. It is changing to a new date with the fall schedule coming up. There are five members in the main cast. Sheldon, played by Jim Parsons, was born and raised in Texas. Leonard, played by Johnny Galecki, was born in Belgium and raised in Illinois. Penny, played by Kaley Cuoco, was born and raised in California. Howard, played by Simon Helberg, was also born and raised in California. Raj, played by Kunal Nayyar, was born in London and raised in India, before coming to the United States.

The story is about five college students, with Sheldon and Leonard sharing an apartment across the hall from Penny. Sheldon and Leonard are both brilliant physicists, and Howard and Raj are both scientists. Leonard and Penny develop a romantic friendship over time. The five students share a great deal of their time together in their apartment, as well as the diner where Penny works as a waitress. It is a delightful comedy and has become a hit show for CBS.
