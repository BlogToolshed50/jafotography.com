hanks to my friend Kevin Pearson for this guest post.

Did you know that mowing your lawn actually protects your home? As funny as this sounds, every time you have your &nbsp;lawn&nbsp; mowed it is like a signal to outsiders and your neighbors. Having the lawn mowed shows that you are home and that any thieves are not welcome to come into your home. It is almost like mowing the lawn is a sort of burglary system to ward off uninvited guests. But, you would be surprised how many people forget to take care of their lawns while away on vacation during the summer. This can be the ultimate mistake for people.

If you are leaving for a vacation this summer, be sure to hire a neighborhood kid to make sure your lawn stays mowed. If he does a great job, you may even want to give him a bonus when all is said and done. Whenever I leave for a vacation during the summer, first I make sure to set the &nbsp;door alarm&nbsp; to protect my home while I am gone. The other way I protect my home is by hiring a neighborhood kid to mow my lawn. Just think about it. What does an unkept lawn say to intruders? It says that no one is home and that your guest is open for burglary. In addition, your lawn may end up violating neighborhood association rules if it is left uncut. It is important to have someone mow your lawn this summer while you are away on vacation.
