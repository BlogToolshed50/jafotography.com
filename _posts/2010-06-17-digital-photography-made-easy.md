Today, digital photography is considered the most popular not only in the business industry but also for personal use. For all those who have shifted from film cameras, it is vital that you know the different terms related to it.

Pixel- means the tiniest part of the digital photo. A photo image is composed of combined millions of pixel. 

Resolution- the over all quantity of pixels in a photo. Increasing the resolution would make the image become sharper. Thus more pixels are needed to achieve a better photo image quality. 

Mega pixel- a photo composed of three to four mega pixels will have a better quality that a photo with only one mega pixel.

Dots Per Inch (DPI) &#8211; this term is used to describe quality of the computer monitor and printer. Specifically, laser printers have more dpi resolution than monitors. Hence, higher the dpi resolution means better quality.

JPEG (joint photographic experts group) &#8211; it correspond to the format for saving images in the digital camera.

Memory Card- this is where the digital files are stored. Memory cards consist of different sizes and capacity. A memory card with higher storage capacity would be more convenient to purchase.

LCD (liquid crystal display) &#8211; almost all digital cameras have this specification. The purpose of LCD is for the photographer to be able to view the scene first before capturing the photo.
