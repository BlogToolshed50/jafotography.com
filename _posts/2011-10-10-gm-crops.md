GM crops are gaining momentum in almost all the countries to meet out the food shortage. Genetically mutated crops are found to be yielding better than the conventional crops. Many Nations are coming out with such crops and propagating the same in various other countries also, but at a cost. Though scientists vouch for the positive aspects of such crops the debate on the negative side is also going on. However, in order to meet out the food requirement in future such high yielding crops have become a must.
