When we are worried over the level of sugar in the blood leading to the many ailments, researchers at the University of South Dakota had conducted a study on the students. It is a matter of interest to observe that the outcome had shown that the level of glucose in the blood influences the decision making capacity of the people. In addition, the researchers found that the level of glucose regulates the eating behaviour of the people.

They have found out that the students who took the caffeine-free soda sweetened either with sugar or the artificial sweetener, their decision making was influenced to a greater extent and they had taken certain positive decisions. On the contrary the so-called diet drinks could not give the requisite energy to make the right decision as they do not have the needed calories.

It is also interesting from their recording that those with higher level of glucose wait until they get the better reward. Those with higher level of glucose are less likely to act impulsively as found by Wang who conducted this study covering about 65 students. He could also confirm that those who had taken the diet drink be bound to act on impulse and take immediate, but small reward.
