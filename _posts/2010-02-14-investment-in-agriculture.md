Though the policy advisers and the planners of every country is worried about the various financial data from manufacturing sectors, the attention given to the growth in the agriculture sector is not up to the mark. This has resulted in the lack of food security in various parts of the globe. The investment in the agriculture sector is decreasing year by year. Even the foreign aid towards agriculture to the poor nations had decreased from 18% in 1979 to 5% in 2007.

It is fact that the rural economies comprising mainly of agriculture sector accelerates poverty reduction four times faster than other sectors as estimated by the World Bank. The prolonged neglect of investment in the rural economies for the road development, improving irrigation facilities and lack of provision of adequate credit to the small farmers, had resulted in the food insecurity worldwide.

It is a matter of consolation that the G8 summit held in Italy promised $20 billion for investing in the agriculture. The small farms should be focused for the development and consolidation. This is sure to bring in the requisite impetus for the food security and reduce the rural unemployment. To adopt such strategy, countries like China, Brazil and Ghana could achieve improvement in the food security level.
