What is a tag?

Tags are keywords that you use in your blog post. If you have a blog about food and you just write a post about food, your possible tags would be, say: food, natural food, food recipe, and any other keywords that you used in your post.

How to use tags

Tags using your blog URLs:

<*a href="http://www.yourblog.com/[tagname]" rel="tag">[keyword]<*/a>
  
(remove asterisks in actual code)

Examples:

<*a href=http://www.yourfoodblog.com/food+recipe" rel=”tag”>food recipe<*/a>

If you are using WordPress blogs you can set tags using WordPress search function:

<*a href=http://www.yourfoodblog.com/blog/search/food+recipe" rel=”tag”>food recipe<*/a>
