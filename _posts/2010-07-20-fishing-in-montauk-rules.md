Written by my friend Lino Brown

I had heard so much about &nbsp;Montauk&nbsp; through movies, word of mouth, and advertisements that I knew I had to go. One day I woke up and it just hit me: I had to go to Montauk. I don&#8217;t know why or how this premonition came about, but it did. After a quick bowl of cereal for breakfast, I logged onto my &nbsp;hughes internet satellite VA&nbsp; and began my research. What I found out was incredible: There&#8217;s not much to do in Montauk. That is, unless you like going to the beach and/or fishing. Being that I&#8217;m 15 minutes from a beach and 2 hours from Montauk by plane, this was a tough call. The adventurer in me finally pulled through and booked the trip. And, um, yes, I went alone, after my friend used &nbsp;High speed internet in Oklahoma&nbsp; and found out it would cost to much to travel from Oklahoma. Not all of us are so lucky in love.

To make sure I got the full Montauk experience, I booked a fishing trip with a chartered boat. This cost quite a bit of money, but being that I live in my parent&#8217;s basement and work full time, it was more than doable. The captain and his first mate were very cool. It was actually a Top Ten day for me, which is saying a lot. I caught a lot of fish and threw them all back. It was more about being out on the sea. I can see why Montauk is known for its fishing. I also visited the Montauk Lighthouse and went to the beach. Those were neat experiences, but nothing like the fishing. I would recommend Montauk solely for the fishing.
