They are the most expressive subjects. They grab attention like no other. They can make a picture look simply stunning. But&#8230;they are unpredictable, ask for immense tolerance and can make you feel frustrated. I am referring to Baby photography.

Photographing babies can be quite a challenge. Here are few baby photography tips to help you snap an enticing baby photo:

Tip 1: Be Vigilant

In baby photography, you are dealing with someone who is absolutely his/her own master. You need to wait for his/her grace. Thus never remove your finger from the camera. You never know when your little one will give you that smile you are looking for.

Tip 2: Choose a friendly location

Friendly here means comfortable and adaptable for your baby. Typically, the best location for this would be in-house. However, if you are planning to take pictures outdoors, make the location adaptable. Keeping your babies’ favorite toy or blanket can come handy while taking baby pictures. Also taking your child to a location before the actual time of shoot helps them adjust to the alien environment.

Tip 3: Make the child familiar with the camera before you shoot

Let your child touch the camera while you hold it. (Don&#8217;t place it in their hands because it will end up in their mouth.) Hold the camera in front of your face and then jump out and say peek-a-boo.

Ask friends, neighbors, and relatives to take pictures of your child while you stand in the background. This helps your child get used to other people being the photographer.

Tip 4: Do you have right camera?

Baby photography demands different camera tactics. The equipment should have high shutter speed (to get a picture when you baby is constantly on a move); less reload time and so on.

It is advisable to use a hand-held camera – if possible, a digital camera. Digital cameras are preferred as you might have to take a good deal of pictures to get that perfect shot. However, digital camera pictures may not look professional sometimes.

Tip 5: Catch the eye

Shoot at the eye level of you child. This makes the image appear more enticing and expressive.

Baby photography requires tweaks in your skill and demands patience. I have gathered these tips from my own observations and talking with my photographer friends. If you would like to add something more, feel free to contact me.
