Eco cleaners are now a massive industry. But, when you are checking those labels to ensure your cleaning is Eco friendly, how do you know what to chose? Green does not necessarily mean natural.

Firstly if you can find all natural cleaning products in your price band, you will be on to a winner. The main problem with conventional products is the amount of toxic synthetic chemical concoctions they include. But, beware &#8211; not all Eco cleaners are necessarily natural. That is not to say they are not Eco or green cleaning products. Not every synthetic compound made by man is bad or dangerous! Just make sure you know what you want. Then, be prepared to really hunt for it!

This is not an issue unless you specifically want natural products (which many people do). If you are hoping to use all natural ingredients you must expect to pay more, and find it harder to find! Perfumes are particularly likely to be synthetic, as they can be very costly to product naturally. Check the label. If a manufacturer is using all natural ingredients they will tell you. Organic cleaners are a good route to go down, though again you will be likely to pay more for the extra dark green credentials!

Do not forget about packaging either. Although it is now possible to make some plastics which are relatively easy to recycle, it does not make plastic a good option. If you can find a supplier who uses glass, or refills bottles, fantastic. If not, admit it, your all natural cleaning product is relying in part, on the massive polluting power of the petrochemical industry for its packaging. I am not here to judge, just to point out the imperfection of green products in general and Eco cleaners in particular.

Beware too, some of the ingredients in your simple green cleaner may not be as harmless as you think. The natural world contains nasty, dangerous stuff too, remember. For example a very reliable, open and honest green cleaning product manufacturer still put lye in their tub and tile cleaner. Lye is caustic soda, an explosive and corrosive alkaline material able to eat through plastic, wood and skin. Admittedly the conventional alternative is perhaps more dangerous, containing larger amounts of the scary ingredients. I just think it is useful to realise that Eco cleaning is not necessarily perfect! 

One way to ensure we make our cleaning Eco friendly is to move away from such a vast array of cleaning products, green or otherwise. We also need to use less product. Even something as non-polluting, gentle and &#8216;green&#8217; as liquid vegetable oil soap is not and Eco option when so much is used that it takes gallons of water to rinse it away.

We should not just rely on the green bottles being safe. The best simple green cleaner is soap and water plus your elbow power. We need to change our attitudes to cleaning to make it more environmentally friendly. Use less product, and spend more time scrubbing. Use less varieties of Eco cleaners so you reduce the range of packaging, transport and so on.

The way to make cleaning Eco friendly is to find one simple green cleaner and use it for as many cleaning jobs as you can
