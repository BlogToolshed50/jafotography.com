Thanks to my friend Steve Fresc for the guest post.

I am a sports nut and can not miss a single football game. This is why I got satellite TV and a DVR. My job takes me to various countries and in many of these countries I never can get my football games. My favorite college team is the Cal Bears out of Berkeley, California and my NFL team is the &nbsp;49ers&nbsp;. With &nbsp;nfl sunday ticket&nbsp; I never miss a single game.

Before each trip It takes be ten minutes to program all the games. The DVR is very user friendly and allows me to program as many programs I want. It is much easier to do then the VCR ever was and I do not have to fiddle with tapes.

When I return from my trip I come home to my dog and my DVR. I pour myself a large Diet Coke with a lot of ice and sit down in my big lazy boy chair and enjoy the college game day like I never left the country. My friends know enough to call me or visit me on the first day back from over seas for they know I am watching my game. I think I look forward to watching all my games recorded on my DVR then I do visiting my mother.
