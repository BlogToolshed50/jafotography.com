As Americans face rising fuel prices, many are looking for ways to save money and energy in their homes. The pressure to reduce energy consumption and costs is inspiring homeowners to challenge the relevance of old heating and hot water solutions and consider other cost-effective options, such as wall-hung boiler technology. 

Wall-hung boilers have been common in homes throughout Europe for the past three decades and are now emerging as a popular alternative for heating homes and businesses in North America. The wall-hung boilers, for instance, are helping homeowners throughout the U.S. cut their home heating and hot water fuel consumption in half. These boilers are fully modulating, meaning they start at a preset, high-fire position and gradually reduce fuel output until the heating demand is met. At this point, the boiler automatically shuts off.

Billed as one of the quietest boilers on the market, Baxi Luna boilers are fired by propane or natural gas. No bigger than a kitchen cabinet, a boiler can be installed in the closet &#8211; saving valuable living space in homes of up to 6,000 square feet. The boiler also is making commercial buildings more efficient. For example, this year a heating specialist in Biddeford, Maine, installed eight high-efficiency condensing boilers in the City Hall and City Theater. People living in the city expect the new heating system to reduce fuel use by at least 50 percent and save taxpayers money even in the face of rising fuel costs.

wall-hung boilers are approved by the American Gas Association and Canadian Standards Association. Consumers can take comfort from the boilers&#8217; Energy Star certification (for energy efficiency) and H-Stamp rating (for operating effectiveness). These environmentally friendly products are quiet enough to install in the back of a large closet, even in the master bedroom. They are ideal for in-floor radiant heating systems and are compatible with any type of air handler, wall or baseboard radiators and custom radiant applications, such as heated towel racks or snow melt.
