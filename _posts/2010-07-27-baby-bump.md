My husband went out and bought every book on pregnancy and babies he could find once I told him that I was pregnant. I should have known then that he would be almost as preoccupied with my pregnancy as I was.

One of the bigger things that’s he’s done, besides making sure that the baby and I are listening to classical music, is renovate our spare bedroom to make it into a &nbsp;nursery&nbsp;. While he gave me a stack of wallpaper samples to pore over, he had &nbsp;sears replacement windows&nbsp; installed to make sure that the room wouldn’t be drafty.

Next, once I had a nice beige and light blue striped wallpaper picked out, he put that up and started assembling a &nbsp;Crib&nbsp; while I picked out curtains for the windows and a matching fitted sheet for the crib. And we did this all before I was five months pregnant!

We still haven’t settled on a name, and since we decided to wait until the baby is born to learn the sex, we have to pick out twice the amount of names. I’ll let him tackle that like he’s tackled the renovation.
