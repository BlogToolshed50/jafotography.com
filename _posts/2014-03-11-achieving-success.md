By studying the successful we will find positive answers that prove to be priceless. It is usually considered that success only entails accumulation of material wealth but that is only a part of success. For what is a million dollars to a depressed soul? Therefore, before we endeavor to go after success we must first understand the greater meaning of success.

Success stimulates an increase in purpose, aspiration, self confidence and encourages even greater success. It is cumulative. It has a great positive effect on all our actions and harmonizes the forces and faculties of the mind. And when we are in harmony we are guided by the Great Force that orchestrates all that is around us. When in this state, we will find that the solutions we seek just come to us at the right moment. It is a position of power. It is in this light that we realize that nothing is more important than success. Even success in small goals is success and has seeds inherent in it to fuel greater success. For example, waking up on time in the morning is success in itself because failure to do this will spoil the whole day.

Another key important effect of success is that our mental states are transformed and we become success conscious as opposed to failure conscious. When we are success conscious, we expect success. That is a powerful state of mind for a mental state which expects failure cannot achieve much. Those who make it in life have an attitude of success, they somehow know that even though the goal they aspire for seems to be out of reach somehow they will reach it. Instead of being preoccupied of why they cannot do it, they are preoccupied about why they can do it. Quite often in life, our failures are simply because of our attitudes, our mental states.

To achieve all round success in life we must therefore begin by understanding the fact that success is more than material possessions. Real success is when our lives are in harmony with everything around us. When we are guided by the Great Spirit, and all our needs are spontaneously met. To arrive to that stage, we must begin by appreciating even the small success and build a mental state of success. And as our mental state is so will be our outer world.
