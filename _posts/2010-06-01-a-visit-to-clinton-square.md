Thanks to Bob Hart for the guest blog

I used to work in Clinton Square, the heart &nbsp;Syracuse&nbsp;, the city at the center of New York State. Clinton Square is the business hub of the entire district, housing many major law firms and important corporate offices and several government buildings. What is often overlooked by the bustling traffic and hurried people of Clinton Square is the historic buildings, beautiful statues, and calm, relaxing ponds.

Free for the summer, my friends and I decided to go into to play some guitar and hang out. Before we left our house, we packed the car, enabled the &nbsp;home security&nbsp; alarm, and hit the road.

The traffic in the city of Syracuse is notorious, and it all ties in a knot around Clinton Square. Only several blocks from the highway to the east and several more to the museums and art centers to the west, the square is surrounded by old buildings, newly restored to their unique and antique beauty. Set right at the center is an old and masterfully sculpted statue of George Washington astride a rearing horse.

On Tuesdays, which happened to be the day we visited the square, a little farmer&#8217;s market gets set up and you can buy fresh produce from the very people who grow it. After we were done playing some music by the long pond that doubles as an outdoors ice rink in the winter, we grabbed a bite to eat in one of the restaurants and headed home after a good day.
