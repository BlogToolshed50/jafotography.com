Thanks for the post from Kirk Wood

When we got back from dinner today I switched on the &nbsp;direct TV&nbsp; and was so excited to see &nbsp;Transformers&nbsp; on! My boyfriend has been telling me about the movie since it came out and I STILL hadn&#8217;t seen it, which means I couldn&#8217;t watch the sequel either. It was the perfect end to our date night for it to be on. Plus, since my bf had seen it before and since it isn&#8217;t exactly the most complicated movie ever, the occasional kitchen or kissing break didn&#8217;t get in the way at all. Who would have thought robots could be so romantic? Though it made me wonder if the attitude I&#8217;ve always sensed coming from my dishwasher might be deeper rooted then I thought. If it comes to life I&#8217;m ordering it to go fix itself, since I&#8217;ve had to have the handyman over twice this month for it already. But I digress. Great movie, and we&#8217;re going to try to watch the sequel next week so I&#8217;m all caught up and we can go watch the newest one together when it comes out. I love my tv.
