Avoid a summer beauty crisis by properly preparing skin for the warm weather. Summer skin care dilemmas are two-fold &#8211; increased dryness due to water loss, wind and sun, as well as increased oil production from outdoor sports and heat. Preparing the face and body for increased outdoor exposure will aid in preventing an onslaught of summer skin dilemmas.

* Summer moisturizers should feel light and weightless on your skin. For face, use an oil-free moisturizer that contains a sunscreen. 

* Water remains key. Eight, 8-oz glasses a day is the minimum required. Herbal teas can also be substituted for water. These fluids help detoxify the skin and keep it looking moist and dewy.

* If you&#8217;re conscious about cellulite, the use of a body contouring cream can help eliminate the appearance of cellulite on thighs, buttocks and hips. While waiting for results, try using a sunless tanner to help conceal cellulite, which tends to be less noticeable on darker skin.

* Vitamin supplements are important in maintaining healthy skin. Flax seed oil is a popular choice as it is good for the skin, the heart and it is also an anti-carcinogenic.

* Stock up on fresh fruits, vegetables and green salads, which help to replace fluids. Adequate fluid intake helps to keep the system well flushed and removes toxins and wastes. This, in turn, helps keep the skin clear and problem-free.

* Looking to rid skin of post-shave bikini line bumps? A simple and effective cure is chamomile tea bags. First, cleanse the area with soap and water. Then lie down and place cool, damp tea bags over the irritated skin. Chamomile contains anti-inflammatory properties, so it is very calming on the skin.

* Mineral filters and a rub-proof, water-resistant formula, it&#8217;s proven to guard even the most sensitive skin against sun damage.

* Don&#8217;t forget to use sunscreen on hands. Hands are exposed to the sun year round, and are the first place on the body to show signs of aging. These signs are often visible in the form of dark spots and sagging skin.

* Walk barefoot. It&#8217;s a good form of massage, helping to strengthen foot muscles, energize aching and tired feet and acts as a natural pumice
