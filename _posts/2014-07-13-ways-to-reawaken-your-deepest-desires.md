However, in reality, most people confuse real urges with &#8220;counterfeit&#8221; urges &#8211; those habits or behaviors we engage in for immediate gratification that don&#8217;t bring us any real satisfaction &#8211; such as stuffing our face with chocolate, over-watching television or impulse shopping. What&#8217;s the difference? Real urges meet deeper needs and get you engaged in the moment. People who follow their urges are more satisfied and more productive. So be ready to recognize your counterfeit urges and embrace your real urges.

Here are 5 Ways you can embrace your urges and live more fully in the moment:

1. Ask yourself what you are feeling. Knowing your emotions will help you be more engaged.

2. What do you really want? Look underneath the urge to the deeper need that you could be meeting. It could be you are wanting comfort or to be appreciated and affirmed.

3. Notice what beliefs are holding you back from expressing your urge. It could be that you think you&#8217;ll look stupid or silly and be embarrassed.

4. Take a risk and follow your urge. Risks are a necessary part of full engagement in your life, leading to more satisfaction and fulfillment.

5. Notice what really satisfies you. Start to notice the difference between the counterfeit urges that keep you stuck in your ruts and routines and those that really give you a sense of satisfaction.
