The minimum dietary energy requirement has arrived by the Food and Agricultural organization of the UN is not made available to 1.02 billion people in the globe.

Despite various steps taken by different governments, the number of people under hunger reached from 824 million in 1990 to this level. The extent of food security to provide sufficient and affordable food to the global population needs improvement. Few regions like Sub Saharan Africa and South Asia are found to be mostly affected with large extent of people deprived of the legitimate minimum dietary requirement.

As revealed in a study and survey, as much as 35% of the population suffers due to hunger in 15 countries in Africa alone. The non provision of at least 2000 Kilocalories per day results in the malnutrition leading to the increased incidence of child mortality.

Though the right to food is stipulated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in various international laws, we are far away from providing sufficient food to the needed. Every nation to found out the ways and means to ensure better food security to the people of the respective country.
