Sleep is one of the most important bodily states for human beings. Without sleep, mankind would not be able to exist. Being of such great necessity for survival and the general well-being, it is most important to create a physically healthy environment for the time spend at rest. In regard to mattresses, many different kinds are manufactured to create the highest standard of sleep comfort. A mattress consisting of memory foam, which originally was developed by the NASA and later used for medical purposes is probably the most comfortable and ideal way to get a good night&#8217;s sleep.

Memory foam mattresses and other products have only recently advanced to general use, thanks to cheaper production and greater availability. Memory foam has a high density and consists of polyurethane and is also known as elastic polyurethane foam. It has the ability to mold into shape when being warmed, while staying firm in cooler temperatures. This makes it an ideal material for manufacturing mattresses. Where the body temperature on top of the mattress warms the memory foam, it molds itself to the shape of the body, while underneath where the warmth of the body does not reach the foam it stays firm, creating the perfect alternative to either a soft or a firm mattress.

Memory foam is still used for medical purposes as people with orthopedic problems such as posture problems or neck pain may find a great relief in the use of foam mattresses or pillows. But not only people with chronic problems benefit from using foam mattresses, as they can also help avoid pressure points, which can and often do affect every average person. Another medical advantage of memory foam concerns people suffering from allergies, as there are no feathers contained within memory foam pillows and memory foam mattresses are far more resistant to parasites such as dust mites than regular mattresses. Apart from physiological reasons, most memory foam mattresses are also able to maintain an even temperature, which makes them ideal for use in every season.
