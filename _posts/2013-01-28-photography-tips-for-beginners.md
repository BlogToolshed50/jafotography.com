Here are a few photography tips for the beginner.
  
These are not written in stone. If they were, we wouldn&#8217;t have a lot of the great photographs we have today.

1). Place the subject with the sun in front or to the side. Placing the sun behind the subject creates dark shadows on the subject.
  
2). For portrait photography &#8211; keep the eyes in sharp focus and shot from around eye level.
  
3). Use diagonals. Use either the subject or surroundings to lead into the main part of the photography that you are wanting the view to focus on.
  
4). Keep in mind the rule of Thirds. The center most block should have nothing inside it or very little. In other words; don&#8217;t shoot center mass.
  
5). Use a tripod whenever possible &#8211; especially when using long telephoto lenses or long shutter speeds.
  
6). Use color. If making portraits or shots you can setup; try not to use dark tones. Try using medium to light colors. These show up very well in photographs.
  
7). Instead of using zoom, move in close. Remember lenses like a 50mm prime do not have zoom capabilities.
  
8). Use props if possible. If you&#8217;re shooting a portrait; flowers &#8211; real or realistic &#8211; lend greatly to the color and background.
  
9). Don&#8217;t be afraid to experiment with camera angles. Shooting a picture with the camera slanted slightly to the left or right impacts the over all look of the shot.
  
10). When shooting photographs of water, make sure the horizon or horizontal plane is level. Remember, lakes normally do not slant left or right.
  
11). BE SAFE! Be aware of your surroundings! There has been more than one photographer falling off a cliff while moving in closer.
  
12). Don&#8217;t be afraid to break the rules! Photography rules should be used as a guide. Some of our most memorable photos have come from photographers not sticking to photography rules.

These are only tips. As I said in the beginning; these are not written in stone. Don&#8217;t be afraid to try new things with your photography.
  
I shot mainly digital photography and these tips come from a digital point of view. Some of the tips have the need for the picture to be reviewed before knowing if something wasn&#8217;t right with the shot.

One of the most important tips and one to always remember: Have Fun with your photography.
  
Photography is my hobby. I have been paid for my photography and I have been published, but I choose to remain an amateur because once it becomes a job with deadlines, bills, and business, for me, it is no longer fun &#8211; it becomes work.
