Achieving your short and long term goals needn&#8217;t be difficult if you know and avoid the real reasons why most people fail.

If you&#8217;ve ever wondered why there&#8217;s a minority of people who seem confident in setting and achieving goals while others seem to struggle for the basics in life, then read on.

Until fairly recently I was like a lot of people. I was unhappy and even a bit worried with the direction my life was going in. I was getting deeper into debt, not making much progress in my career and certainly hadn&#8217;t really begun building any sort of financial security for my future.

In short, I&#8217;d become stuck in a rut. And it wasn&#8217;t because I was short on ambitions and dreams for a better future either.

The truth is, though, every time I was determined to set a goal and make a big change, I&#8217;d do it for a while but always seemed to eventually slip back into my old way of doing things.

But why? Why is it so hard to change even when you desperately want to?

I knew other people managed to achieve their dreams and ambitions and it probably wasn&#8217;t impossible for me to either if I just had the confidence and know how. And I knew this was probably true for the majority of other people too.

A study by the Social Security Administration, following one hundred people at the start of their working careers for 40 years until they reached retirement age, found only 1 would be wealthy, 4 financially secure and the rest continuing to work to make ends meet, broke or dead!

That&#8217;s 5% successful, 95% unsuccessful.

So what does the successful 5% know, that the 95% doesn&#8217;t?

Since around 1995 I&#8217;ve made it my mission to find out. I&#8217;ve studied a library&#8217;s worth of books, recordings, courses and seminars on subjects such as psychology, philosophy, spirituality, positive mindset, goal-setting and even the law of attraction.

What I discovered was our brains are actually hard-wired to sabotage any attempts at changing. Let me explain:

The first thing to realize is, if you&#8217;re unhappy or unsuccessful in any area of your life, it&#8217;s not your fault. You&#8217;re just unaware of why you&#8217;re getting the results you&#8217;re getting and how you can change them.

You&#8217;re unaware, or conscious, of this because the vast majority of our results are controlled at a subconscious level. If you&#8217;ve ever heard the phrase, &#8220;he&#8217;s a creature of habit&#8221;, nothing could be closer to the truth.

Most of our lives are governed by daily routines and knee-jerk reactions we call habits.

A habit is an acquired behavior pattern followed until it has become almost involuntary. The reason habits become almost involuntary is because they become hardwired into our brain.

Every time you think or do something, connections between your brain cells are created or existing ones followed.

That&#8217;s why when you&#8217;re learning something new and have no previous points of reference, you find it difficult.

You don&#8217;t have any existing neural pathways in your brain yet to cope with the new situation and have to create them.

At first, the neural pathways are weak, but with repetition the connections between brain cells become stronger and stronger until it becomes your automatic way of thinking. It becomes &#8216;hardwired&#8217; into your brain.

You don&#8217;t have to &#8216;think&#8217; about doing a thing, it&#8217;s just your automatic response when faced with similar circumstances. You&#8217;re not aware or conscious of doing it; it&#8217;s done at a subconscious level.

Habits can be very useful. Imagine going through your day having to make conscious decisions about everything you do.

However, once habits have become hardwired into our brains, they become very difficult for us to change. In fact, they&#8217;re often so difficult for us to change they sometimes become known as addictions or obsessions.

In fact it&#8217;s some of these very habits that are sabotaging your attempts to achieve your short and long term goals.

To start making and reaching your personal goals you need to first start researching and using the simple but little used secrets to reverse your &#8216;hard-wiring&#8217; and &#8216;re-wire&#8217; your brain so you can start effortlessly achieving anything you want.
