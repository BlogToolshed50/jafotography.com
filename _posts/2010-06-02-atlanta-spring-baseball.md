This post is from guest blogger James Hetfield.

My favorite spring sport to watch is baseball. Every year I get excited when March and April roll around because I know that baseball is starting up. From spring training until the start of the regular season, I am all about baseball. Sure there are other sports I like to watch on my satellite TV, but baseball is hands-down the one I get the most excited for.

The Atlanta Braves are my favorite team. I remember watching them with my dad growing up. We were always able to see them because all of their games were on TBS (Turner Broadcasting System), and that is the reason I grew so attached to them. I have favorite teams in other sports, but none of them can compare to the love I have for my beloved Atlanta Braves.

I remember watching them during their terrible years, and then the year they went from worst to first was one of the most enjoyable sports years I have ever had. When I got out of college I moved to Nevada and I signed up for &nbsp;Direcctv Las Vegas, Nevada&nbsp; so I could watch all the Braves games. When Francisco Cabrera hit a seeing eye single in between third base and shortstop, and Sid Bream came lumbering around to beat the throw home giving the Braves the pennant, I flew out of my chair screaming in delight. No other sport compares to the excitement I feel when I watch the &nbsp;Atlanta&nbsp;Braves play baseball.
